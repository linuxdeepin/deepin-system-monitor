.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ownership
retrieves and prints the "ownership tag" that can be set on Compaq
computers. Contrary to all other programs of the
.B dmidecode
package,
.B ownership
doesn't print any version information, nor labels, but only the raw
ownership tag. This should help its integration in scripts.
